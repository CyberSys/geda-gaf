May 2014
========

- Added python package `xorn' which provides proxy classes for easy
  access to the storage backend, base64 encoding/decoding, and helper
  functions for writing files in a safe way

- Added python package `xorn.geda' which supports reading and writing
  gEDA files and gEDA attribute handling

- Added command-line utility `xorn' with two sub-commands:
    extract - extract embedded symbols or pixmaps from a schematic
    find-symbol-by-pinout - find symbols matching a given pinout


April 2014
==========

- Python extension: Members of data classes can now be passed as
  constructor arguments

- Added symbol and pixmap attributes

- Python extension: All functions now raise KeyError if an object
  argument does not exist


March 2014
==========

- Storage library: Functions returning an object list now have an
  integer return type (instead of void).  They will return 0 on
  success and -1 on failure.  The returned pointer may be NULL if no
  objects are returned.

- Added API documentation.  Type `make doxygen' to build.

- New functions:
    xorn_object_is_selected (xorn.storage.object_is_selected)
    xorn_select_difference  (xorn.storage.select_difference)
    xorn_select_including   (xorn.storage.select_including)
    xorn_select_excluding   (xorn.storage.select_excluding)

- Objects now have an intrinsic order

- Text objects can be attached to net and component objects

- New functions:
    xorn_get_object_location     (xorn.storage.Revision.get_object_location)
    xorn_relocate_object         (xorn.storage.Revision.relocate_object)
    xorn_get_objects_attached_to (xorn.storage.get_objects_attached_to)
    xorn_select_attached_to      (xorn.storage.select_attached_to)
