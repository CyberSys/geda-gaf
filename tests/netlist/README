Tests for xorn-netlist
======================

These are the original tests used by gnetlist which compare the
netlister output for a set of test schematics with known good output
files.  To run the tests, type:

    make check

Since xorn-netlist produces slightly different output than the
original gnetlist, the reference output files have been modified to
accomodate these differences.

- The original order in which the pins on a net are listed in gnetlist
  is hard to predict and depends on gnetlist's internal connectivity
  checking algorithm.  Since it's *almost* the order of the pins in
  the file, they are now sorted in that order.

The tests do NOT cover most of the more advanced features of the
backends; they are basically just a bunch of standard schematics run
through each backend, whether meaningful or not.

Please note that the tests only make sure there are no accidental new
defects.  In particular, it has not been checked whether the original
output files were correct in the first place.
